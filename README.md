## Introduction

This is a basic project that search for a user on github and then returns a few of the user data and it's repositories's names and descriptions.

## Demo

## How to get up and running
 Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run the project in development mode

## How to commit into this repo? 
- `git commit` since this repo uses husky and cli commitlint, a frindly cli will appear to help you commit a clear message

## Disclaimer
The github api is public and it has a limit of 60 request for a unauthenticated user

## Automation Framework

This automation framework is based on Mocha JavaScript test framework

Project Structure:
 - automation-test (directory):
    - this directory contains all the files required for the automation - this is a main directory
 - helpers (directory):
    - This folder contains multiple JS files that are used for creating driver object, performaing navigation on web page, verifying expected results and preparing testdata
    - fetchData.js - this file is used to connect to availble backend services, from which we can get the data required for our tests
    - navigation.js - this file is used to navigate in the web application (opening pages, clicking on elements, scroll) anything related to navigation can be implemented here
    - screenChecks.js - this file is used to check the expected result on any of element on web application (we perform asserts)
    - setUp.js - this file is used to prepare the environment for scripts to execute (creating browser driver object) 
 - testCases (directory): 
    - Conatins all the test cases (as of now, only contains a E2E test script)
 - locators.json - this is a json file that holds all the unique identifiers for each of the web element that we want to interact with

Dependencies:
All the required dependencies for the automation test are added as dev dependencies and package.json is updated 
(mocha, mocha-steps, mochawesome, node-fetch, selenium-webdriver, chromedriver, chai)

Running Automation:
- follow the above step "How to get up and running"
- Once the Web Application is running, we can run automation scripts with below command
Command: npm run teste2e
- Once the execution is completed, a HTML test report is generated by mochawesome

Scope of Improvement:
- We can refactor setUp.js and manage browser drivers under before root hook globally and can be implemented to accept browser type from end user
- If we manage test cases on any of test management tools (e.g Jira) we can configure the hooks and use API provided by test management tools (e.g zyphr in case of Jira) to update test results to test management tools
- As the number of test grows and to save execution time, we can implement parallel execution of test scripts, so that multiple scripts can run at same time.
